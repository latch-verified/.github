#### Why Verified?

For any area of bioinformatics, the set of possible tools and algorithms is vast
and constantly evolving. It is difficult to benchmark and stay up-to-date with
the best tools, integrate them from academic repositories to production-grade
environments, and expose them to bench scientists with interfaces.

Latch Verified is a suite of high-quality bioinformatics software for major
domains of bioinformatics featuring:

  * benchmarked tool-selection from frequent literature reviews
  * maintained + tested open-source code
  * reliable execution battle-tested by industry leaders and prominent labs
  * intuitive workflow parameters distilled from the feedback of hundreds of
    scientists

#### Verified Workflows

  * [Bulk RNA-seq](https://github.com/latch-verified/bulk-rnaseq) produces transcript/gene counts from your sequencing data
  * [Differential Expression](https://github.com/latch-verified/diff-exp) creates a list of significant transcripts/genes
from a controlled experiment
  * [Pathway Analysis](https://github.com/latch-verified/pathway) implicates pathways + gene ontologies from significant
genes
